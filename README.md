Build an application that displays a list of categories and nominees. 

Please follow the design in the wireframe below.

Run yarn backend to start the server and get access to API methods such as getBallotData.

When you click on a nominee, we should highlight the nominee card and save the selections using the React useState hook. 

A user can only select one nominee per category, and we should be able to see all of their selections highlighted. 

The selected nominee card should follow the style guides below.

Make the layout responsive with at least one breakpoint (your choice as to how it looks on a smaller screen width).

Once the user is finished making their selections, they can click on a submit button that displays a results modal screen. 

A user can dismiss the modal by clicking on the close button (follow the wireframe below).
